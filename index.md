# Junzhi Ning
I am an MRes (Master of Research) student in Machine Learning at Imperial College London, supervised by **Dr. Matthieu Komorowski** and **Dr. Guang Yang**. I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from The University of Melbourne and an Honours degree in Data Science from The University of Sydney.

- My current research focuses on applying advanced AI techniques, including:
  - **GANs** and **Generative models**, to **medical imaging**.
  - **Medical data synthesis** and **CXR image translation**.

**I am actively seeking PhD and RA opportunities.**

Feel free to contact me for Chat and Research Opportunities.

## Selected Projects

- **Multi-class Classification using Text-Vision Fusion Model**  
  Designed a multimodal model integrating EfficientNet for image features and BERT for text features. Conducted experiments on hyperparameters and modules, performing an ablation study of vision and text models, and optimizing learning rate, dropout, and other key factors.

- **Multi-class Classification using self-implemented Multilayer Perceptron**  
  Developed an MLP from scratch using NumPy for a 10-class classification task. Experimented with activation functions, optimizers, and regularization techniques, conducting ablation studies to refine model performance.
